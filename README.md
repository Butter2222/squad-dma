## Acknowledgments
This project builds upon the original work created by [UC Forum Thread](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/escape-from-tarkov/482418-2d-map-dma-radar-wip.html) and its continuation [EFT-DMA-Radar-v2](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/escape-from-tarkov/639021-dma-radar-v2.html) by x0m, Keegi and MasterKeef. It is basically a fork of a EFT-DMA-Radar-v2 adapted to UE4 Squad base. It has a lot of perfomance issues, as well as some bugs.
